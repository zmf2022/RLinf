    emulate per-environment sensor / action latency.

    ``step``/``chunk_step``/``reset`` only *sample* the delay; the wait itself is
    taken by ``await wait_delay()``. The env APIs are synchronous but are driven
    from the env worker's event loop, so sleeping inside them would block every
    other coroutine in the process for the whole delay. Sampled delays accumulate
    until they are waited out, so a caller that drains them late still pays the
    full latency rather than losing it.

    Sampled delays are also buffered for metrics and consumed via
    ``insert_delay_metrics()``.
