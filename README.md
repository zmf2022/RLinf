## Key Features

RLinf has high flexibility to support diverse RL training workflows (PPO, GRPO, SAC and so on), while hiding the complexity of distributed programming. Users can easily scale RL training to a large number of GPU nodes without modifying code, meeting the increasing demand of computation for RL training.

The high flexibility allows RLinf to explore more efficient scheduling and execution. The hybrid execution mode for embodied RL achieves up to **2.434×** throughput compared to existing frameworks.

Multiple Backend Integrations

- FSDP + HuggingFace/SGLang/vLLM: rapid adaptation to new models and algorithms, ideal for beginners and fast prototyping.
- Megatron + SGLang/vLLM: optimized for large-scale training, delivering maximum efficiency for expert users with demanding workloads.

## Examples

### Embodied AI

RLinf supports SFT, simulation RL, and real-world RL for World Action Models (WAM) and Vision-Language-Action Models (VLA). The current support list is as follows:

## Quick Start
**Installation:** Users can refer to our [installation guide](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/start/installation.html) to install RLinf. We recommend users to use our provided docker image (i.e., [Installation Method 1](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/start/installation.html#installation-method-1-docker-image)), as the environment and dependencies of embodied RL are complex.

**Run a simple example:** After setting up the environment, users can run a simple example of embodied RL with ManiSkill3 simulator following [this document](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/start/vla.html).

**SOTA RL Training Reproduction:** RLinf provides end-to-end recipes that reproduce or match **state-of-the-art (SOTA) RL results** out of the box—users can directly run our configs and scripts to obtain SOTA performance without custom engineering. Check out our [example gallery](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/examples/index.html) for more details.


## Awesome Community Projects with RLinf
We are excited to see a growing ecosystem of projects building on top of or integrate with RLinf, spanning embodied AI, robotics, and long-horizon agentic systems. Here are some awesome community projects:
- [Qwen-VLA](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-VLA): A unified vision-language-action model that uses RLinf for reinforcement learning to optimize closed-loop task success.
- [i4h-workflows](https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-workflows/tree/main/workflows/rheo): NVIDIA team open sourced RL-based workflow built on Isaac ecosystem, integrating RLinf for healthcare-oriented embodied intelligence.
- [pi-StepNFT](https://github.com/wangst0181/pi-StepNFT): Extends RLinf for step-level training and optimization of π-series VLA models.
- [Dexbotic](https://github.com/dexmal/dexbotic): A robotics + RL system integrating RLinf for scalable training and deployment of embodied agents.
- [RoboTwin](https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin): A digital twin + robotics platform leveraging RLinf for large-scale embodied RL training.
- [IsaacLab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/tree/develop/scripts/reinforcement_learning/rlinf): Official integration of RLinf within IsaacLab, enabling seamless reinforcement learning workflows on top of NVIDIA Isaac Sim based robotics environments.
- [RISE](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/RISE): A robot reinforcement learning framework based on a compositional world model, using RLinf for online reinforcement learning.
