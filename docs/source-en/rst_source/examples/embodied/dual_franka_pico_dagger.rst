   Collect dual-Franka teleoperation data with VR / PICO.

This guide explains how to use PICO to collect demonstrations in the dual-Franka
TCP-rot6d environment, then run online Human-Gated DAgger with PICO human
interventions. For dual-arm hardware, real-time kernel, and camera checks, start
with :doc:`dual_franka`; for the PICO / XRoboToolkit data publishing pipeline,
see :doc:`franka_vr`; for the single-arm HG-DAgger workflow, see
:doc:`hg-dagger`.

Overview
--------

Use the left and right PICO controllers to control the two Franka arms. First
collect tcp_rot6d LeRobot data, then prepare the OpenPI π₀.₅ student checkpoint
by following :doc:`dual_franka`, and finally launch online HG-DAgger on the real
robot.

Installation and Node Layout
----------------------------

Software Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the robot-node installation on every node that directly communicates with
a Franka. Choose ``LIBFRANKA_VERSION`` from the official `Franka compatibility
matrix <https://frankarobotics.github.io/docs/compatibility.html>`_; avoid
libfranka ``0.18.0``.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   cd RLinf

   export LIBFRANKA_VERSION=0.15.0       # replace with your compatible version
   bash requirements/install.sh embodied --env franka-franky --use-mirror
   source .venv/bin/activate

The ``franka-franky`` environment installs the ``franka`` extra, including
``pyzmq`` for the PICO consumer side. See :doc:`franka_vr` for the PICO headset,
XRoboToolkit PC Service, and ``vr_data_publisher`` setup and validation.

Inference Node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the OpenPI environment on the GPU inference node used by the online DAgger
actor / rollout components:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   cd RLinf
   bash requirements/install.sh embodied --model openpi --env maniskill_libero
   source .venv/bin/activate

Ray Node Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The collection config uses two Franka nodes:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 18 32 50

   * - Rank
     - Role
     - Notes
   * - ``0``
     - Left-arm control, env worker, three cameras, PICO consumer
     - Requires the foot pedal and access to the PICO ZeroMQ address.
   * - ``1``
     - Right-arm control
     - Only needs the right-arm Franka / Robotiq control path.

The online DAgger config uses three nodes:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 18 32 50

   * - Rank
     - Role
     - Notes
   * - ``0``
     - inference / rollout / actor
     - Usually the GPU node running OpenPI.
   * - ``1``
     - Left-arm control, env worker, three cameras, PICO consumer
     - Requires the foot pedal and access to the PICO ZeroMQ address.
   * - ``2``
     - Right-arm control
     - Only needs the right-arm Franka / Robotiq control path.

.. warning::

   Ray captures the Python interpreter and environment variables at
   ``ray start`` time. Before starting Ray, finish setting
   ``source .venv/bin/activate``, ``PYTHONPATH``, ``RLINF_NODE_RANK``,
   ``RLINF_KEYBOARD_DEVICE``, and the ROS / Franka environment variables.

Cluster Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before running the experiment, set up the Ray cluster correctly.

.. warning::
   This step is critical. Small configuration mistakes can lead to missing
   dependencies or failure to control the robot.

RLinf uses Ray for distributed execution. When you run `ray start` on a node,
Ray records the current Python interpreter path and environment variables; all
processes that Ray launches on that node inherit the same environment.

RLinf provides ``ray_utils/realworld/setup_before_ray.sh`` to help set a
consistent environment before starting Ray on each node. Modify it for your
setup and source it on every node.

The script usually handles:

1. Sourcing the correct virtual environment when using a custom installation.

2. Loading the runtime environment required by Franka, Robotiq, and cameras on
   Franka controller nodes.

3. Setting RLinf environment variables on all nodes:

.. code-block:: bash

   export PYTHONPATH=<path_to_your_RLinf_repo>:$PYTHONPATH
   export RLINF_NODE_RANK=<node_rank_of_this_node>
   export RLINF_COMM_NET_DEVICES=<network_device_for_communication> # optional if there is only one NIC

``RLINF_NODE_RANK`` should be set to ``0 ~ N-1`` across the ``N`` nodes in the
cluster. It uniquely identifies each node in the config. The PICO consumer /
env worker node also needs the foot-pedal device exported before ``ray start``:

.. code-block:: bash

   export RLINF_KEYBOARD_DEVICE=/dev/input/eventXX

For collection, ``N=2``: rank ``0`` is left arm / env / PICO consumer, and
rank ``1`` is right arm. For DAgger, ``N=3``: rank ``0`` is OpenPI inference /
actor, rank ``1`` is left arm / env / PICO consumer, and rank ``2`` is right
arm.

After the environment is ready, start Ray on each node:

``<head_node_ip_address>`` must be reachable by all other cluster nodes.

.. code-block:: bash

   # On the head node (node rank 0)
   ray start --head --port=6379 --node-ip-address=<head_node_ip_address>

   # On worker nodes (node rank 1 ~ N-1)
   ray start --address='<head_node_ip_address>:6379'

Use `ray status` to check that the cluster started correctly.


Configuration
-------------

Main Config Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 44 56

   * - Config
     - Purpose
   * - ``examples/embodiment/config/realworld_dual_franka_collect_data_pico.yaml``
     - PICO dual-arm tcp_rot6d data collection.
   * - ``examples/embodiment/config/realworld_dual_franka_dagger_openpi.yaml``
     - Online HG-DAgger with PICO human intervention.
   * - ``examples/embodiment/config/env/realworld_dual_franka_tcp_rot6d.yaml``
     - Default real-world dual-arm TCP-rot6d environment config.

Hardware Placeholders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replace the following fields in the collection and DAgger configs:

* ``LEFT_ROBOT_IP`` / ``RIGHT_ROBOT_IP``: FCI IPs for the left and right arms.
* ``BASE_CAMERA_SERIAL``, ``LEFT_CAMERA_SERIAL``, ``RIGHT_CAMERA_SERIAL``:
  RealSense / Lumos camera serials or stable ``/dev/v4l/by-id`` paths.
* ``base_camera_type``, ``left_camera_type``, ``right_camera_type``: camera
  types, usually ``realsense``, ``lumos``, ``lumos``.
* ``left_gripper_type`` / ``right_gripper_type``: left and right gripper types.
* ``LEFT_GRIPPER_CONNECTION`` / ``RIGHT_GRIPPER_CONNECTION``: stable
  ``/dev/serial/by-id`` paths for the left and right gripper adapters.
* ``left_controller_node_rank`` / ``right_controller_node_rank``: ranks of the
  left and right arm controller nodes. The collection config usually uses
  ``0`` / ``1``; the three-node DAgger config usually uses ``1`` / ``2``.
* ``node_rank``: rank of the env / PICO consumer node that owns the DualFranka
  hardware config. The collection config usually uses ``0``; the three-node
  DAgger config usually uses ``1``.
* ``TASK_DESCRIPTION``: task text used by collection and DAgger. It should match
  the task text used to train the checkpoint.
* ``joint_reset_qpos``: set from first-frame joint means in the collected data,
  or from a safe home pose.
* ``target_ee_pose`` and ``ee_pose_limit_min/max``: re-check for your workspace.

PICO Config
~~~~~~~~~~~

The collection config uses ``env.eval.pico.zmq_addr``; the DAgger config uses
``env.train.pico.zmq_addr``. This address must match the publisher bind address.

The ZeroMQ stream is subscribed by the env worker / PICO intervention node. In
this guide's config, that is the rank ``0`` left-arm controller node during
collection, and the rank ``1`` left-arm controller node during DAgger.

For dual-arm PICO teleoperation, set ``pico.hand`` to ``"dual"`` so the left
and right PICO controllers bind to the left and right robot arms.

.. code-block:: yaml

   env:
     train:
       smooth_intervene: True
       use_spacemouse: False
       use_pico: True
       pico:
         zmq_addr: "tcp://<vr_publisher_ip>:<port>"
         hand: "dual"
         control_trigger: "grip"
         calibration:
           button: "trigger"

If the publisher and env worker run on the same machine, use
``ipc:///tmp/vr_data.ipc``. If they run on different machines, bind the
publisher to ``tcp://0.0.0.0:<port>`` and set the RLinf consumer to
``tcp://<vr_publisher_ip>:<port>``. Do not use ``0.0.0.0`` as the consumer
address.

Default controller semantics:

.. code-block:: text

   left grip  -> intervene on the left arm
   right grip -> intervene on the right arm
   left X/Y   -> close / open left gripper
   right A/B  -> close / open right gripper
   trigger    -> recalibrate the operator base from the current headset heading

``hold_current_when_inactive`` differs between collection and DAgger:

* Collection uses ``True``: an inactive arm holds the current TCP, which is
  suitable for pure teleoperation collection.
* DAgger uses ``False``: an inactive arm retains its rollout action. When either
  ``grip`` is held, only that arm's action is replaced by the corresponding
  PICO action, while the other arm retains its rollout action.

Dual-arm DAgger composes intervention records per arm. For example, when only
the left arm is being intervened on, the 20D action that is executed and written
to ``intervene_action`` is:

.. code-block:: text

   [left-arm PICO 10D action, right-arm rollout 10D action]

The reverse applies when only the right arm is being intervened on. Replacing
either arm sets ``intervene_flag=True``; no intervention record is produced only
when neither arm is being intervened on. The online LeRobot collector still
stores the complete successful episode. With ``only_save_expert: True``, the
sampler uses ``intervene_flag`` to expose only action chunks whose non-padded
frames are all human corrections.


Start the PICO Data Stream
--------------------------

Start the XRoboToolkit PC Service on the PICO publisher machine, then start
the VR data publisher. The concrete installation paths are described in
:doc:`franka_vr`.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /opt/apps/roboticsservice
   bash runService.sh

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /path/to/pico_software/XRoboToolkit-Teleop-Sample-Python
   source .venv/bin/activate
   cd /path/to/pico_software
   python -m vr_data_publisher --config configs/vr_bridge.yaml

On the node running the env worker, verify that PICO data is reachable:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /path/to/RLinf
   source .venv/bin/activate
   export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:${PYTHONPATH:-}
   python toolkits/realworld_check/test_pico_data.py \
       --zmq-addr tcp://<vr_publisher_ip>:<port>

Only continue to real-robot collection or DAgger after the output refreshes
continuously and ``grip``, ``trigger``, ``A/B``, and ``X/Y`` change as expected.


Collect PICO Demonstrations
---------------------------

Run Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the left and right Franka arms, Robotiq grippers, cameras, foot pedal,
PICO data stream, and collection Ray cluster are ready, run this on the head
node:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash examples/embodiment/collect_data.sh realworld_dual_franka_collect_data_pico

Foot-pedal keys:

* ``a``: start recording; pressing it again while recording aborts the current
  buffer and discards it.
* ``b``: increment ``segment_id`` for subtask boundaries.
* ``c``: mark success, write the LeRobot shard, and end the current episode.

PICO operation:

1. Wear the headset and face the front of the workspace.
2. Pull ``trigger`` to calibrate the PICO base.
3. Hold left / right ``grip`` to intervene on the left / right arm.
4. Use ``X/Y`` for the left gripper and ``A/B`` for the right gripper.
5. When one hand releases ``grip``, the corresponding arm holds the current TCP.

The collection script writes under ``logs/<timestamp>/``:

* replay-buffer trajectories: ``demos/``
* LeRobot data: ``collected_data/rank_0/id_0/``; later shards are ``id_1``,
  ``id_2``

PICO dual-arm collection already uses the ``realworld_dual_franka_tcp_rot6d``
environment, so the actions are already tcp_rot6d. You do not need to run the
``backfill_tcp_rot6d.py`` step used by the GELLO joint-data workflow.

.. note::

   ``data_collection.resume: True`` only resumes under the same ``save_dir``.
   ``collect_data.sh`` creates a new ``logs/<timestamp>`` directory by default.
   To append across runs, set ``data_collection.save_dir`` to a fixed path.


Prepare the Checkpoint
----------------------

Online DAgger requires a deployable OpenPI checkpoint. For data organization,
normalization stats, SFT, and checkpoint directory preparation, follow the SFT
and deployment-checkpoint sections in :doc:`dual_franka`.

When using data collected from this page, the data already comes from the
``realworld_dual_franka_tcp_rot6d`` environment, so do not run the GELLO
joint-data ``backfill_tcp_rot6d.py`` step again.

After the checkpoint is ready, set the following in
``examples/embodiment/config/realworld_dual_franka_dagger_openpi.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   rollout:
     model:
       model_path: /path/to/deploy/global_step_<N>

   actor:
     model:
       openpi_data:
         repo_id: <repo_id>/tcp_rot6d_v1


Run Online HG-DAgger
--------------------

Check Key DAgger Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before launch, confirm these fields:

.. code-block:: yaml

   algorithm:
     dagger:
       only_save_expert: True
       online_lerobot:
         enabled: True
         only_success: True
         robot_type: "dual_FR3"
         fps: 10
         finalize_interval: 1
         data_path: ${runner.logger.log_path}/online_lerobot
         rolling_lerobot_window_size: 50000
         min_frames: 1
         lerobot_num_workers: 0

   env:
     train:
       smooth_intervene: True
       use_spacemouse: False
       use_pico: True
       keyboard_reward_wrapper: eval_control
       pico:
         zmq_addr: "tcp://<vr_publisher_ip>:<port>"
         hand: "dual"
         hold_current_when_inactive: False
     eval:
       use_spacemouse: False
       use_pico: False

``online_lerobot.enabled: True`` enables the online LeRobot data path. The env worker collects rollouts by episode and sends episodes that satisfy the configured filters to the actor; the actor adds them to ``RollingLeRobotDataset`` for training, so online training no longer uses the trajectory replay buffer.

``smooth_intervene: True`` removes action-chunk boundary stalls while PICO is active. If the final frame of a chunk is human-controlled, the env worker skips the next policy inference and executes a shape-compatible dummy chunk instead. PICO actions still override active arms, while inactive frames hold the measured TCP pose. Normal model inference resumes after the final chunk frame is no longer intervened or the episode ends. This mode is PICO-only (``use_pico: True``, ``use_spacemouse: False``) and currently requires one environment per env-worker pipeline stage.

``only_success: True`` discards failed rollouts and keeps only successful episodes. ``only_save_expert: True`` still archives each complete successful episode, but training only samples chunk starts where every non-padded frame in the action chunk has ``intervene_flag=True``. Because a dual-arm frame is marked as an intervention when either arm is replaced, such a chunk may combine one arm's PICO action with the other arm's rollout action. Every successful episode is archived immediately under ``${runner.logger.log_path}/online_lerobot/rank_0/id_<N>/``. ``env.eval.use_pico: False`` means evaluation uses the policy alone, without human intervention.

The real-world DAgger config intentionally omits beta-related fields because it does not configure ``rollout.expert_model``. Beta only controls action mixing between a model expert and the student; human intervention here is determined by the PICO intervention wrapper.

Run DAgger
~~~~~~~~~~

After the DAgger Ray cluster is running, start online training on the head node:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash examples/embodiment/run_realworld_async.sh realworld_dual_franka_dagger_openpi

During the run:

* ``a``: start one policy rollout from idle.
* left / right ``grip``: intervene on the corresponding arm; the other arm
  continues executing the policy action if it is not being intervened on.
* ``b``: mark failure and end the current rollout.
* ``c``: mark success and end the current rollout.

After each episode, the env resets and waits for ``a`` again. During policy
execution, hold ``grip`` only when you need to correct the policy, then release
it to let the policy continue. Holding either ``grip`` combines that arm's PICO
action with the other arm's rollout action into a complete 20D
``info["intervene_action"]``. After a successful termination, the complete
episode is sent in memory to the actor and written as an online LeRobot shard;
failed episodes are discarded. The actor retains the complete physical archive
but exposes only fully intervention-labeled chunks to training.

Monitoring
----------

Start TensorBoard:

.. code-block:: bash

   tensorboard --logdir ./logs

Recommended metrics:

* ``train/dagger/actor_loss``: supervised loss on expert-only action chunks.
* ``train/lerobot_dataset/total_episodes``: number of successful episodes received by the actor.
* ``train/lerobot_dataset/physical_frames``: number of received LeRobot physical frames.
* ``train/lerobot_dataset/logical_samples``: number of expert-valid trainable chunk starts in the rolling window.
* ``train/lerobot_dataset/num_sub_datasets``: number of currently loaded LeRobot shards.
* ``train/actor/lr`` and ``train/actor/grad_norm``: training stability.

During collection and online DAgger, inspect ``logs/<timestamp>/run_embodiment.log``
to confirm the successful episode count and the LeRobot write path. Online
DAgger shards are stored under
``logs/<timestamp>-realworld_dual_franka_dagger_openpi/online_lerobot/rank_0/``.


Troubleshooting
---------------

**DAgger waits too long and does not start**
   This is expected behavior for ``keyboard_reward_wrapper: eval_control``. If
   DAgger waits for a long time after launch, press the foot pedal mapped to
   keyboard ``a`` to start the rollout.
