   XSquare Turtle2 dual-arm robot used for SAC/CNN real-world button-pressing training.

Train a real-world policy on the XSquare Turtle2 dual-arm robot. You will enter the vendor controller container, install RLinf dependencies, set target poses for button pressing, and launch SAC/CNN training across robot and GPU nodes.

Overview
--------

Hardware Setup
--------------

The real-world setup requires:

- **Robot**: XSquare Turtle2 dual-arm robot
- **Cameras**: Up to 3 RGB cameras mounted on the robot (IDs 0–2)
- **Training / Rollout Node**: A computer with GPU support for running the CNN policy
- **Robot Controller Node**: A small computer (GPU not required) connected to the robot in the same local network

.. warning::

  Ensure the training node and the robot controller node are in the **same local network**.


Installation
------------

The controller node and the training/rollout node(s) require different software dependencies.

Robot Controller Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The XSquare Turtle2 platform ships with its own SDK and ROS-based controller stack. **Please ensure that you have entered the official Docker container of Xsquare before starting the following installation.**. Contact `XSquare <https://x2robot.com>`_
for the exact Docker image and startup instructions.

After entering the XSquare Docker container, clone the RLinf repository inside it:

.. code:: bash

   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
   # git clone https://gh-proxy.com/github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   git clone https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   cd RLinf

Then install the RLinf Python dependencies for the embodied real-world setup:

.. code:: bash

   # For mainland China users, you can add the `--use-mirror` flag for better speed.
   bash requirements/install.sh embodied --env xsquare_turtle2
   source .venv/bin/activate

Training / Rollout Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. Clone RLinf Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
   # git clone https://gh-proxy.com/github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   git clone https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   cd RLinf

B. Install Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Option 1: Docker Image**

.. code:: bash

   # use maniskill_libero image for training / rollout nodes
   docker run -it --rm --gpus all \
      --shm-size 20g \
      --network host \
      --name rlinf \
      -v .:/workspace/RLinf \
      rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.4-maniskill_libero
      # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
      # docker.1ms.run/rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.4-maniskill_libero

**Option 2: Custom Environment**

.. code:: bash

   # install openvla + maniskill_libero environment on training / rollout nodes
   # For mainland China users, you can add the `--use-mirror` flag for better speed.
   bash requirements/install.sh embodied --model openvla --env maniskill_libero
   source .venv/bin/activate


Download the Model
------------------

Before starting training, download the pretrained ResNet CNN backbone:

.. code:: bash

   # Method 1: Using git clone
   git lfs install
   git clone https://huggingface.co/RLinf/RLinf-ResNet10-pretrained

   # Method 2: Using huggingface-hub
   # For mainland China users:
   # export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
   pip install huggingface-hub
   hf download RLinf/RLinf-ResNet10-pretrained --local-dir RLinf-ResNet10-pretrained

After downloading, update the ``model_path`` field in the configuration YAML file.


Run It
------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Acquire the Target End-Effector Pose**

For each task, you need to record the target end-effector pose that triggers a success
signal. Move the robot arm(s) to the desired target pose manually via the XSquare control
interface, then read back the pose.

The pose is stored as Euler angles in the format
``[x, y, z, rz, ry, rx]`` (XSquare convention). Record this for both
arms if using dual-arm mode.

Cluster Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the experiment, set up the Ray cluster properly.

.. warning::

  This step is critical. Any misconfiguration may cause missing packages or failure
  to control the robot.

RLinf uses Ray for managing distributed environments. When ``ray start`` is run on
a node, the current Python interpreter and environment variables are recorded and
inherited by all subsequent Ray processes on that node.

We provide ``ray_utils/realworld/setup_before_ray.sh`` to help configure the environment
before starting Ray on each node. Modify and source it before ``ray start``.

The script sets up the following:

1. Source the correct virtual Python environment (see Dependency Installation above).
2. On the controller node: ensure the XSquare SDK packages are discoverable (this is
   handled automatically when using the XSquare official Docker image).
3. Set RLinf environment variables on all nodes:

.. code-block:: bash

   export PYTHONPATH=<path_to_your_RLinf_repo>:$PYTHONPATH
   export RLINF_NODE_RANK=<node_rank_of_this_node>
   export RLINF_COMM_NET_DEVICES=<network_device>  # Optional if only one NIC

``RLINF_NODE_RANK`` is set to ``0 ~ N-1`` for each of the ``N`` nodes.
``RLINF_COMM_NET_DEVICES`` is only needed if the machine has multiple network interfaces;
check with ``ifconfig`` or ``ip addr``.

Start Ray on each node after sourcing the script:

.. code-block:: bash

   # On the head node (node rank 0)
   ray start --head --port=6379 --node-ip-address=<head_node_ip_address>

   # On worker nodes (node rank 1 ~ N-1)
   ray start --address='<head_node_ip_address>:6379'

Run ``ray status`` to verify the cluster is up.

Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify ``examples/embodiment/config/realworld_button_turtle2_sac_cnn.yaml`` to match
your setup.

Key fields to update:

.. code-block:: yaml

  cluster:
    num_nodes: 2  # 1 training/rollout node + 1 controller node
    component_placement:
      actor:
        node_group: "gpu"
        placement: 0
      rollout:
        node_group: "gpu"
        placement: 0
      env:
        node_group: turtle2
        placement: 0
    node_groups:
      - label: "gpu"
        node_ranks: 0
      - label: turtle2
        node_ranks: 1
        hardware:
          type: Turtle2
          configs:
            - node_rank: 1

  env:
    train:
      override_cfg:
        is_dummy: False
        use_arm_ids: [1]          # 0=left arm, 1=right arm; use [0,1] for dual arm
        use_camera_ids: [2]       # camera IDs to use (0, 1, or 2)
        target_ee_pose:           # [[left_arm_pose], [right_arm_pose]], Euler [x,y,z,rz,ry,rx]
          - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
          - [0.3, 0.0, 0.15, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]

  actor:
    model:
      model_path: "/path/to/RLinf-ResNet10-pretrained"
      state_dim: 6    # 6 for single arm (xyz+euler); 12 for dual arm
      action_dim: 6   # 6 for single arm (xyz_delta+rpy_delta); 12 for dual arm

  rollout:
    model:
      model_path: "/path/to/RLinf-ResNet10-pretrained"

For the **button-pressing** task, the ``target_ee_pose`` defines both the success
threshold position and the reset position (arms reset to a pose slightly above the
target along the Z axis).

Testing the Setup (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before running the full experiment, you can verify the setup using dummy mode:

Set ``is_dummy: True`` in both ``env.train.override_cfg`` and ``env.eval.override_cfg``
to enable dummy mode (no real robot required). This validates the cluster and model
pipeline without physical robot interaction.

Run on the head node:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash examples/embodiment/run_realworld_async.sh realworld_dummy_turtle2_sac_cnn

Run It
~~~~~~

After verifying the setup, start the real-world training experiment on the head node:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash examples/embodiment/run_realworld_async.sh realworld_button_turtle2_sac_cnn
