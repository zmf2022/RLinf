Example Gallery
===============

This section presents the collection of **examples currently supported by RLinf**,
showcasing how the framework can be applied across different scenarios and
demonstrating its efficiency in practice.
This example gallery is continuously expanding, covering new scenarios and tasks to highlight RLinf's flexibility and efficiency.

Embodied intelligence is RLinf's primary focus. The embodied gallery is split into seven
entry points — pick the one that matches your starting question:
