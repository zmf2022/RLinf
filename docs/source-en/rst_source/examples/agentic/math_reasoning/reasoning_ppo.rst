PPO training for Math Reasoning
==================================

Use this recipe when you want actor-critic PPO for the same math-reasoning task covered by :doc:`reasoning`. PPO and GRPO share most launch and data settings, so this page only lists the PPO-specific differences.

Overview
--------

Use this recipe when you want actor-critic PPO for the same math-reasoning setup
used by the GRPO example.

.. grid:: 2 4 4 4
   :gutter: 2

   .. grid-item-card:: Model
      :text-align: center

      Qwen2.5-1.5B

   .. grid-item-card:: Algorithm
      :text-align: center

      PPO with GAE advantages and a critic

   .. grid-item-card:: Data

      AReaL-boba math reasoning data

      Multi-GPU Megatron training

Dataset
-------

We also use the boba dataset. For details, see :doc:`reasoning`.

How PPO Works
-------------

Use standard PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) with GAE advantages and a critic. For the algorithm reference, see :doc:`PPO <../../../reference/algorithms/ppo>`.

Run It
------

**1. Config file**

For common path, cluster, and runner fields, see :doc:`Training configuration <../../../reference/configuration>`. Recommended config example:

- ``examples/reasoning/config/math/qwen2.5-1.5b-ppo-megatron.yaml``

**2. Launch command**

The launch command for PPO training is basically the same as for GRPO training. We also use ``run_main_grpo_math.sh`` as the entry script. RLinf automatically determines whether to use PPO training based on whether there are critic-related configurations in the YAML config file and the value of ``adv_type`` (PPO typically uses ``gae`` as the advantage function).


Visualization and Results
-------------------------

We fine-tune the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model with PPO. The orange line is RLinf and the blue line is VeRL; both use the same algorithm configuration. For common metric meanings, see :doc:`Training metrics <../../../reference/metrics>`.

Since the base capability of the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model is relatively weak, the overall reward values are low. However, as training progresses, the reward values increase significantly.
