Release Notes
=============

RLinf v0.2 Release
------------------

🎉 Introducing RLinf v0.2.

RLinf v0.2 focuses on two major directions: **Real-World RL** and **Multi-agent RL** systems. To support these goals, RLinf now supports real-world platforms including **XSquare Turtle2 Arms** and the **Franka Arm**, while offering a richer set of embodied benchmarks, simulators, models, algorithms, together with **native asynchronous training** designed for high-throughput workloads. This release also strengthens real-world deployment, sim-to-real, and co-training workflows, alongside more robust data and replay infrastructure and improved training stability. For multi-agent training, RLinf introduces **native multi-agent support** for extensible multi-agent RL algorithms and unified data interfaces, lowering the barrier to developing and scaling multi-agent workloads while enabling rapid reproduction of advanced training solutions such as **WideSeek-R1**.

RLinf v0.1 Release
------------------

🎉 Introducing RLinf v0.1.

Built on robust system-level scheduling and communication components, RLinf is a scalable and flexible framework for post-training via reinforcement learning in embodiment, reasoning, and agent scenarios. The framework has been validated on popular models and tasks and achieves state-of-the-art model performance and training throughput, showcasing its extensibility, versatility, and efficiency in diverse scenarios.

Embodied Intelligence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Supported end-to-end embodied RL training on multiple mainstream simulators (e.g., ManiSkill, Libero, MetaWorld, CALVIN), achieving state-of-the-art performance with multiple VLA models (e.g., OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT, π₀, π₀.₅, GR00T) and algorithms (GRPO, PPO), reaching a success rate of up to 99%.

- Up to 143.4% faster training (2.434× throughput) compared to existing frameworks, with flexibly allocated, decoupled, and hybrid execution modes, scaling effortlessly to thousands of GPUs.

- The effectiveness of RL training has been verified in ManiSkill, LIBERO, MetaWorld, and CALVIN and reproducible best-practice scripts are provided in our embodiment examples.

Agent & Reasoning RL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- With 1.5B and 7B models, RLinf achieves state-of-the-art results on AIME 24, AIME 25, and GPQA-Diamond benchmarks.

- Through pipeline parallelism (20%+) and automatic scheduling (30%+), RLinf demonstrates significant efficiency improvements and strong reasoning capabilities.

- Supported auto scheduling and scaling of Megatron-based training. SGLang/vLLM and Megatron can automatically scale down/up during training to achieve maximum throughput, delivering 40%+ speedup compared to static placement.

- Introduced the first open-source 1.5B online RL agent, boosting code completion accuracy by 50%+, outperforming even 32B-scale models.
